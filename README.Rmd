Alzheimer DataLENS is an open data analysis platform which aims to advance Alzheimer’s disease research by enabling the analysis, visualization, and sharing of -omics data. DataLENS will houses bioinformatics pipelines for the analysis of  -omics data on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias as well as streamlined web interfaces which allow neuroscientists to browse and query the results of these analyses. Currently, we have identified are over 50 possible genetic, proteomics, and transcriptomics studies which are suitable for DataLENS. Some example datasets which could be made available on DataLENS now or in the future include:

**Gene Expression Data**
1. Analysis of 60 human microarray expression profiling datasets across various neurodegenerative diseases (26 Alzheimer’s, 21 Lewy body dementia, 13 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia). See Refs. 1 and 2.
2. Analysis of 30+ public human datasets spanning 19 brain regions and 5 cohorts.
3. Analysis of data from several Alzheimer’s disease animal models.
4. Three single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.

**Proteomics Data**
1. Analysis of two proteomics studies, with additional studies currently in progress.

**Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**
1. Results from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) GWAS meta-analysis.
2. Results from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership – Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD) GWAS study.

**Pathways**
1. Protein-protein interaction data and integration of expression, epigenetic, and genetic data.


## Installation

You can install the the development version of DataLENS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ayushnoori/datalens")
```

## Authors
Alzheimer DataLENS was created by [Ayush Noori](mailto:anoori1@mgh.harvard.edu) for CS50 at Harvard College.


<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(datalens) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
